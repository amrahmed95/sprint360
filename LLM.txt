# LLM.txt - Sprint360 Project Overview

## Project Overview
Sprint360 is a modern web application built with Next.js, designed for a software development company. It features a responsive landing page with sections for services, portfolio, about, contact, and blog. The app includes form handling, email notifications, reCAPTCHA integration, and Docker-based deployment.The project focuses on scalable, modular components and server-first rendering.
The codebase follows clean architecture and separation of concerns.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 16+ (App Router), React, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, PostCSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **Database/Integrations**: Airtable (for calculators and forms)
- **Email**: Resend API
- **Security**: reCAPTCHA v3
- **Deployment**: Docker, nginx (reverse proxy with SSL)
- **Development**: ESLint, Docker Compose

## Key Pages and Components

### Home Page (app/page.tsx)
Main landing page with hero section, features, services overview, partners, and CTA.
- Components: HeroSection, FeaturesSection, ServicesSection, PartnersSection, CTASection

### About Page (app/about/page.jsx)
Company information including hero, journey, team, values, vision/mission.
- Components: AboutHero, AboutJourney, AboutTeam, AboutValues, AboutVisionMission

### Contact Page (app/contact/page.jsx)
Contact form with Calendly integration, consent checkbox, and alternative contact methods.
- Components: ContactForm, ContactHero, CalendlyBlock, ConsentCheckbox
- API: /api/contact (POST) - Handles form submissions

### Services Pages (app/services/)
Dynamic routing for different services.
- Layout: services/layout.tsx
- Components: ServicesGrid, ServiceCard, CalendlyModal
- Data: services.tsx (service definitions)

### Portfolio (app/portfolio/page-temp.jsx)
Portfolio showcase (temporary implementation).

### Blog (app/blog/page.tsx)
Blog listing page.

### Internal Estimate (app/InternalEstimate/page.tsx)
Cost estimation tool using Airtable integration.

### Project Cost Calculator (app/project-cost-calculator/)
Advanced calculator with lead form.
- API: /api/lead (likely for form handling)

## API Endpoints
- `/api/health` (GET) - Health check
- `/api/contact` (POST) - Contact form submission
- `/api/lead` (POST) - Lead form submission (project calculator)

## Key Integrations
- **Airtable**: Used for data storage (calculators, forms)
- **Resend**: Email notifications for form submissions
- **reCAPTCHA**: Spam protection on forms
- **Calendly**: Scheduling integration

## Configuration Files
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `next.config.ts` - Next.js configuration
- `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS setup
- `postcss.config.mjs` - PostCSS configuration
- `eslint.config.mjs` - ESLint rules

## Docker Setup
- **Development**: `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Runs app on port 3000, nginx on 80/443
- **Production**: `docker-compose.yml` - Production build with nginx proxy
- **nginx**: Handles SSL termination, static file serving, and proxying to Next.js

## Content Prioritization for AI Analysis
1. **User-Facing Content**: Focus on page components (app/*/page.*) for understanding site structure
2. **Business Logic**: API routes (app/api/*) for backend functionality
3. **Integrations**: lib/ files for external service connections
4. **Configuration**: Docker and nginx files for deployment understanding
5. **Types**: types/ for data structures

## Important Notes for AI
- This is a Next.js 14+ app using the App Router
- Forms use server actions and API routes
- SSL is handled by nginx, not Next.js
- Development uses Docker for full-stack setup
- Content is primarily in JSX/TSX components, not separate markdown files
- For SEO and content analysis, examine the page components and their rendered output

## Quick Start
1. `pnpm install` - Install dependencies
2. `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up` - Start development environment
3. Access at http://localhost or http://sprint360 (after adding to hosts)

## Deployment
- Build production image: `docker-compose build`
- Deploy: `docker-compose up -d`
- Ensure SSL certificates are in `./certs/` for HTTPS
